## How to
The project was built using:
* ActionScript 3
* [Flixel](http://flixel.org/index.html) engine (some old version, but it is embeded in sources)
* [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/) as IDE
* [tIDE](http://tide.codeplex.com/) for generating levels

## Graphical sources
Most graphical elements were created by [Ilie CiorbÄƒ](http://ilieciorba.com/) as Illustrator/SVG objects. 
There are still some elements that were not implemented in game (like broccoli eating bobek).
